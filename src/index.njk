description: I’m passionate about frontend development and building beautiful UIs, but love solving problems across the stack. In my most recent role I worked with Vue.js, HTML, CSS and Node.js, and have experience building apps with React.js and Ruby on Rails. I'm keen to learn new tools and skills, and thrive working in dynamic teams with people who love what they do. Looking for my next challenge in Sydney or in the UK, remote roles welcome.
