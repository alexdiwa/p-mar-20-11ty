Hi! <span role="img" aria-label="hand wave">👋🏽</span> I’m Alex, and I’m a software developer and former scientist.

I’m passionate about the frontend, but love solving problems across the stack. In my most recent role I worked with Vue.js, HTML, CSS and Node.js, but have experience writing vanilla JavaScript, React.js and Ruby on Rails. I have the drive and eagerness to learn new tools, and love sharing what I've learnt with other people. Looking for my next role in Sydney or in the UK, remote roles welcome.

Hire me because:

- <span role="img" aria-label="caterpillar">🐛</span> I’m good at finding and fixing bugs
- <span role="img" aria-label="art palette">🎨</span> I have a great eye for design and love building beautiful UIs
- <span role="img" aria-label="pencil">✏️</span> I write docs that are clear and easy to understand
- <span role="img" aria-label="handshake">🤝</span> I communicate well with my teammates
- <span role="img" aria-label="books">📚</span> I love learning new things (right now I’m big on testing and a11y!)
- <span role="img" aria-label="brain">🧠</span> I’m passionate about knowledge-sharing
