Hi! 👋🏽 I’m Alex, and I’m a software developer and former scientist. I’m passionate about frontend development, but am comfortable working across the stack. In my most recent role I worked with Vue.js, HTML, CSS and Node.js, but have experience writing vanilla JavaScript, React.js and Ruby on Rails, and I have the drive and eagerness to learn new tools. Looking for my next role in Sydney or in the UK, remote roles welcome. Get in touch!

Hire me because:

- 🐛 I’m good at finding and fixing bugs
- 🎨 I have a great eye for design and love building beautiful UIs
- ✏️ I write docs that are clear and easy to understand
- 🤝 I communicate well with my teammates
- 📚 I love learning new things (right now I’m big on testing and a11y!)
- 🧠 I’m passionate about knowledge-sharing
- 💞 I approach everything I do with kindness, empathy and compassion
- ☕️ I’m the supportive coffee buddy you’ve always needed
